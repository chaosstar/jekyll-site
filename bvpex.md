How to Solve Boundary Value Problems in R
=========================================

`bvpSolve` is a good package for boundary value problems. It

 - Has both shooting and collocation methods
 - Uses many of the same solvers and input formats as `deSolve`
 - Is authored by the person who developed the methods used in the MATLAB package `bvpc4`

First, load the package

```{r message=FALSE}
library(bvpSolve)
```


Write a function that defines your differential equations and set some parameters:

```{r }
bvpDES <- function (Time, State, Pars) {
  with(as.list(c(State, Pars)), {
    dx = a*x - b*(x^2) - y
    dy = (r - a + (2*b*x))*(alpha - (2 * beta * y))/(-2*beta)
    return(list(c(dx, dy)))
  })
}

parms <- c(                 
  alpha <- 0.4675,
  beta <- 1,
  a <- 1.1,
  b <- 1.1,
  r <- 0.1
  )
```

Set your initial and boundary conditions.  Use `NA` to for your unknown boundary conditions.  Also create a vector of times for the output data.

```{r }
x0 <- 0.2
xT = 0.6
T <- 10                     
yini <- c(x=x0, y=NA)       
yend <- c(x=xT, y=NA)              
times <- seq(0,T, length.out=(T+1))
```

Use the function `bvpshoot` to solve the problem.  **I recommend specifying `method="bdf"` if you have a stiff system of equations or are sensitive to initial conditions.**  You must also specify a guess.

```{r }
out <- bvpshoot(yini=yini, x=times, func=bvpDES, yend=yend, parms=parms, guess = 0.1, method="bdf")

out
```

Now plot the results:

```{r }
plot(out[,1], out[,2])
```
