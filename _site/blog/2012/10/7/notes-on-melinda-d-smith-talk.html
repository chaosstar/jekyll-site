<p><em><a href="http://wp.natsci.colostate.edu/smithlab/sample-page/">Melinda D. Smith</a> of Colorado State spoke this week at Davis’s Ecology and Evolution seminar.</em></p>
<p><em>These are my rough notes from the talk. Any errors or misrepresentations are my own.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, a shorter version of the talk is available <a href="http://www.sanparks.org/assets/docs/parks_kruger/conservation/scientific/noticeboard/science_network_meeting_2012/6-9-smith.pdf">as a PDF here</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Melinda’s general framework: Ecological implications of global change. How human caused global changes (climate, biochemical modification, land use), ultimately change community structure and function.</li>
<li>Grasslands (inc. steppe, tundra, savanna, and scrublands) cover 40% of earth’s surface. Sequester large amounts of C, economically important for grazing, house most remaining megafauna</li>
<li>Shaped by climate variability, both directly and indirectly through grazing and fire. All these regimes are being modified by humans.
<ul>
<li>Increased fire frequency</li>
<li>Timing, location, and intensity of grazing.</li>
<li>Big question: can we generalize findings about these effects across grasslands?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Focus of this talk is <em>savannah grasslands</em>: mesic savannah, where rain is &gt;500mm/yr, and C4 grasses dominate</li>
<li>Some argue fire and grazing affect ecosystem structure/function in <em>fundamentally different ways</em> across different grasslands</li>
<li>How are S. African grasslands different than North American?
<ul>
<li>Scholes et al. (2003) argued that the systems are different</li>
<li>SA grasslands have longer evolutionary history due to no glaciation events</li>
<li>They have lower soil fertility</li>
<li>Greater large herbivore and plant diversity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Big questions:
<ul>
<li>Can we forecast impacts?</li>
<li>Are differences between knowledge of systems based on different approaches by scientists?</li>
<li>Are impacts differences between the systems?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take a comparative approach</li>
<li>Manipulate fire and grazing</li>
<li>Study sights
<ul>
<li>Two long-term experiments: Konza Prairie LTER, Kruger Nat’l Park</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Comparison
<ul>
<li>Similar biomass response to precipitation</li>
<li>Similar tree/shrub/grass balance</li>
<li>Elephants in S. African site, no equivalent in N. America</li>
<li>Fire key control on woody plants</li>
<li>Question: What about the <em>herbaceous plant community?</em></li>
<li>Differences: Soil nutrients, temperature, herbivore richness, but similar in when rainfall comes.</li>
<li>Not comparing apples to oranges, <em>orchards to orchards</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Overarching hypothesis: <em>Fire and grazing will be broadly <strong>convergent</strong> in their effects on <strong>ecosystem processes</strong>, but the <strong>plant community responses</strong> will <strong>diverge</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>Why? C4 grasses dominate both, but in SA there is much more diversity due to older system (@Scholes2003a)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Experiments
<ul>
<li>Removed large herbivores using 40m<sup>2</sup> exclosures</li>
<li>Used existing 1, 3-4, and never-burn treated areas</li>
<li>n=63</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Results
<ul>
<li>Divergence in plant community response. In SA, community is richer in unburned than in 1-yr communities. No effect in N. America. Similar overall plant diversity. But on 2-m<sup>2</sup> scale, SA plots are less diverse due to lower spatial turnover</li>
<li>Response to fire and grazing together.
<ul>
<li>Rapid decline in richness in exclosures in N. America</li>
<li>In SA, decline was lagged an occurred inly in the absence of fire</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In N. America, only grazing affected plant group composition. In SA, only fire affected it.</li>
<li>For NA, compositional differences driven by reduced abundance of a few C3 species.</li>
<li>For SA, it was due to turnover of dominant species and (C4 and legumes)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No difference between the systems in terms of NPP. Both continued to be driven mostly by annual precipitation.</li>
<li>Unexpected findings</li>
<li>Differences between fire/herbivore interactions:
<ul>
<li>In NA, the fire-grazing interactions arises become one species dominate irrespective of fire regime Bison graze these out. See Collins (1998).</li>
<li>Magnitude and speed of plant community response was much greater in NA than in SA.<br /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to think about this?</li>
<li>Hierarchy of mechanisms expected to differentially drive community and ecosystem change with removal of grazing:
<ul>
<li>individual response –&gt; species re-ordering –&gt; species migration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Differences in grazing <em>intensity</em> does not appear to be driving different responses. Similar levels found in both systems.</li>
<li>Future directions</li>
<li>Phylogenetic analysis (work by colleague)
<ul>
<li>So far, found significant clade overlap but no species overlap</li>
<li>Only in SA do we see differences among clades in fire response</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This comparison suggests generalzation may be easier to do at the ecosystem level, but not at the community level. If we understand the relationship between those two scales, we’ll have a better handle on prediction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="q-a">Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li>What relevant traits should we be measuring?
<ul>
<li>Still figuring this out, but currently looking at nutrient content, tensile strength, root/shoot ratio, traits thought to be related to fire and grazing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are management implications?
<ul>
<li>Aiming to provide managers with info to explain how they might modify composition/diversity and still maintain functions they want. Also, understanding fire frequencies that maintain diversity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does the historical temporal/spatial distribution of fire compare to managed fires?
<ul>
<li>Definite differences. Fire was much more patchy in the past, and at much larger scales. We’ve simplified the system. Return interval <em>is</em> thought to be 3-4 years in both NA and SA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Would NA behave more like SA if we had the same herbivore assemblage?
<ul>
<li>Probably not, because of the differences in plant community and diversity</li>
</ul></li>
