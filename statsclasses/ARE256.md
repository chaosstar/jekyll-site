**Other info and comments**:"ARE 256: The master's level Ag Econ econometrics class - this is a more accessible version of the ECN 240 series, which is for PhD economists and is pretty hard core. Its basically lots of regression (cross sectional and time series), and its more applicable to analysis of observational (rather than experimental) data.  

I took it with Havenner who I liked but some found him confusing.  He covered the basics of econometrics with enough detail that you can explore further on your own.  He focused on understanding the 'why' not just the 'how'. I don't know if he is still teaching it.  "
