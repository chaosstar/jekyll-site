**Other info and comments**: Dr Hijmans writes:

> I teach "Quantitative Geography" (GEO200CN), a graduate course that is part of the core curriculum for the Geography grad group students.  It is a survey course about spatial data analysis and modeling, not a "pure" statistics course. It including subjects such as point pattern analysis, kriging, inference, cellular automata and Markov chains. It has lectures, disussions, and a intensive lab (we use R). 

> [Non-geography] students can take the class (and they do) without taking other geo classes. The ideal preparation is intro to stats + regression, a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) class, and familiarity with R.
