**Official Description**: Pre-requisite: PLS 206, Applied Multivariate Modeling in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, or a comparable graduate level course in statistical analysis. Some previous exposure to linear models and basic concepts of likelihood and probability strongly recommended.
 
In ecology and related environmental fields, the best available data about important questions are often imperfectly controlled, not well balanced, and/or full of missing values. Further, they often raise issues of nesting and autocorrelation. In this course, we introduce two key tools for analyzing such environmental data sets: classical mixed models and Bayesian statistical analysis. Throughout the course, the foundational tool is the linear (and generalized linear) model with random effects. The emphasis is on statistical model building; on practice rather than theory; and on understanding the methods rather than learning particular computer skills.

**Instructors**: Andrew Latimer, Ken Tate, Leslie Roche

**Other info and comments**: From Andrew Latimer: "We'll probably teach this in Fall 2013 as a 3-credit, twice a week class. It's much more of an applied stats class than McElreath's Bayesian course. The focus is fairly narrowly on mixed models, though these are very widely applicable. We will probably not cover state space models this time and spend more time on the basics, though if the class members demand it, we could speed up."
 
**Software Used**: In-class case studies conducted in STATA and OpenBUGS, but students welcome to use R or other software.
